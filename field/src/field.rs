/// A commutative ring, `R`, with prime characteristic, `p`.
///
/// This permits elements like:
/// - A single finite field element.
/// - A symbolic expression which would evaluate to a field element.
/// - An array of finite field elements.
/// - A polynomial with coefficients in a finite field.
///
/// ### Mathematical Description
///
/// Mathematically, a commutative ring is a set of objects which supports an addition-like
/// like operation, `+`, and a multiplication-like operation `*`.
///
/// Let `x, y, z` denote arbitrary elements of the set.
///
/// Then, an operation is addition-like if it satisfies the following properties:
/// - Commutativity => `x + y = y + x`
/// - Associativity => `x + (y + z) = (x + y) + z`
/// - Unit => There exists an identity element `ZERO` satisfying `x + ZERO = x`.
/// - Inverses => For every `x` there exists a unique inverse `(-x)` satisfying `x + (-x) = ZERO`
///
/// Similarly, an operation is multiplication-like if it satisfies the following properties:
/// - Commutativity => `x * y = y * x`
/// - Associativity => `x * (y * z) = (x * y) * z`
/// - Unit => There exists an identity element `ONE` satisfying `x * ONE = x`.
/// - Distributivity => The two operations `+` and `*` must together satisfy `x * (y + z) = (x * y) + (x * z)`
///
/// Unlike in the addition case, we do not require inverses to exist with respect to `*`.
///
/// The simplest examples of commutative rings are the integers (`ℤ`), and the integers mod `N` (`ℤ/N`).
///
/// The characteristic of a ring is the smallest positive integer `r` such that `0 = r . 1 = 1 + 1 + ... + 1 (r times)`.
/// For example, the characteristic of the modulo ring `ℤ/N` is `N`.
///
/// Rings with prime characteristic are particularly special due to their close relationship with finite fields.
