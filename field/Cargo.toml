# These are some of clippy's nursery (i.e., experimental) lints that we like.
# By default, nursery lints are allowed. Some of the lints below have made good
# suggestions which we fixed. The others didn't have any findings, so we can
# assume they don't have that many false positives. Let's enable them to
# prevent future problems.
