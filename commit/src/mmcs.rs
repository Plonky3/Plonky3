/// to a batch of matrices at once even if their widths and heights differ.

/// When a particular row index is opened, it is interpreted directly as a row index for matrices
/// with the largest height. For matrices with smaller heights, some bits of the row index are
/// removed (from the least-significant side) to get the effective row index. These semantics are
/// useful in the FRI protocol. See the documentation for `open_batch` for more details.
