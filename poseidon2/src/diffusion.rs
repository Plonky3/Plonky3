//! This file implements a trait for linear layers that satisfy these three properties.

// The requirements translate to the following 3 properties:
// 1: All entries are non 0.
// 2: No Subspace Trails.
// 3: For a matrix of the form 1 + D, the diagonal D should also be non 0.
//
// Properties 1 and 3 are essentially immediate to check and a sufficient condition for property 2
// is that the minimal polynomial of the matrix M and all its powers M^2, ..., M^{2WIDTH} are maximal and irreducible.
// This is equivalent to all the characteristic polynomials being irreducible.
//
// These can be verified by the following sage code (Changing field/vector/length as desired):
//
// field = GF(2^31 - 1);
// length = 16;
// vector = [-2,  1,   2,   4,   8,  16,  32,  64, 128, 256, 1024, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536];
// const_mat = matrix.ones(field, length);
// diag_mat  = diagonal_matrix(field, vector);
// for i in range(1, 2 * length + 1)
//      assert ((const_mat + diag_mat)^i).characteristic_polynomial().is_irreducible()
