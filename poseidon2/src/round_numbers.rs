//! As the security analysis of Poseidon2 is identical to that of Poseidon,
//! the relevant constraints regarding the number of full/partial rounds required can be found in
//! the original paper: https://eprint.iacr.org/2019/458.pdf and the associated codebase:
//! https://extgit.iaik.tugraz.at/krypto/hadeshash (See generate_params_poseidon.sage)
//!
//! These constraints are broken down into 6 equations:
//! statistical, interpolation, groebner 1, 2, 3 and
//! an extra constraint coming from the paper https://eprint.iacr.org/2023/537.pdf.
//!
//! For our parameters (M = 128, p > 2^30, WIDTH = t >= 8, D = alpha < 12),
//! the statistical constraint always simplifies to requiring RF >= 6.
//! Additionally p does not appear in Groebner 3 or the constraint coming from https://eprint.iacr.org/2023/537.pdf.
//! The remaining 3 constraints all can be rearranged into the form:
//! F(RF, RP) >= G(p) where G is a function which is non-decreasing with respect to p.
//!
//! Thus, if some tuple (M, p, WIDTH, D, RF, RP) satisfies all constraints, then so will
//! the tuple (M, q, WIDTH, D, RF, RP) for any 2^30 < q < p.
//! Moreover if RF, RP are the "optimal" round numbers (Optimal meaning minimising the number of s-box operations we need to perform)
//! for two tuples (M, p, WIDTH, D) and (M, q, WIDTH, D), then
//! they will also be optimal for (M, r, WIDTH, D) for any q < r < p.
//!
//! We compute the optimal required number of external (full) and internal (partial) rounds using:
//! https://github.com/0xPolygonZero/hash-constants/blob/master/calc_round_numbers.py
//! Using the above analysis we can conclude that the round numbers are equal
//! for all 31 bit primes and 64 bit primes respectively.
